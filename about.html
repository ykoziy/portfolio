        <p class="lead">I am Yuriy Koziy, Software Engineer and Web Developer. I am originally from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine located in Central Ukraine. Since I was young I got this fascination for taking things apart and seeing how they work and even improve them in some ways.
        Later when I got to actually use a computer as a kid, I would soon learn how to take them apart and even attempt programming.
        As a software engineer I believe that it is very important to keep up with changes in technology as it develops so you would deliver better software solutions to almost any problem.
        What I do to keep my knowledge current is mainly through reading books and blogs related to my field and always try new ideas out and see how they could further improve my skills.
        As Anton Chekhov once mentioned "knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice."</p>
        <p class="lead">Other hobbies that I have are cycling, photography, traveling and reading (good luck becoming software engineer if you hate reading).
        Also relating to computers my other hobbies are graphic design and 3D modeling, some examples of my 3D work are shown in my portfolio.</p>
